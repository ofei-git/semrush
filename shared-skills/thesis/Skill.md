# Thesis Development

Generates thesis options that transform a topic into a memorable argument. Helps strategists, writers, and editors find the central idea that organizes content and makes it stick.

## The Core Problem This Solves

A topic is what content is about. A thesis is what content argues. Most content describes a subject but doesn't make an argument — which is why it gets forgotten. This skill helps find the argument.

**Topic:** "How to create a marketing strategy"
**Thesis:** "Marketing strategy answers one question: where does your customer decide?"

The thesis gives the reader something to hold onto when the details fade. It's what they'd tell a colleague if asked "what was that article about?"

## When This Skill Applies

Use this skill when someone:
- Has a topic or article idea and needs to find the argument
- Has a brief or outline that feels like a list without a through-line
- Has a draft that needs a stronger through-line
- Asks for help making content more memorable or differentiated

## Process

### Step 1: Extract the Core Elements

From whatever input is provided, identify:
- **The topic:** What is this content about?
- **The audience:** Who is this for? What's their situation?
- **The structure (if present):** What sections, steps, or points are planned?
- **The goal:** What should the reader be able to do or understand?

### Step 2: Run the Thesis Diagnostics

Work through these questions internally to generate options:

**What's the misconception?** What do most people assume about this topic that isn't quite right? The thesis can be the correction.

**What's the transformation?** If the reader fully absorbed this, what would change for them? Name that shift.

**What connects the parts?** If there are multiple tips, steps, or sections — what principle do they all serve? That principle might be the thesis.

**What would you argue at dinner?** If someone asked your opinion on this topic and you had to take a position, what would it be?

**What's the business case for believing this?** Why does this argument matter for results, not just understanding?

### Step 3: Generate 3-5 Thesis Options

For each option, provide:

**The thesis statement** — One sentence that captures the argument. It should be specific enough to organize the content and memorable enough to repeat.

**Why it works** — 1-2 sentences on the business case: why this argument matters for the reader's results, not just their understanding. What does believing this unlock?

**How it organizes the content** — Brief note on how existing sections/steps become evidence for this argument (if structure was provided).

### Step 4: Note Trade-offs

After presenting options, briefly note:
- Which thesis is boldest (highest reward, highest risk)
- Which is safest (defensible, but less differentiated)
- Which best fits the existing structure (if applicable)

## Output Format

---

**Topic:** [Extracted topic]

**Audience:** [Who this is for]

---

**Option 1: [Short label]**

*"[Thesis statement]"*

Why it works: [Business case — why this matters for results]

[If structure provided]: How it organizes: [Brief note on how sections become evidence]

---

**Option 2: [Short label]**

*"[Thesis statement]"*

Why it works: [Business case]

[How it organizes, if applicable]

---

[Continue for 3-5 options]

---

**Trade-offs:**
- **Boldest:** [Option X] — [why it's higher risk/reward]
- **Safest:** [Option Y] — [why it's more defensible]
- **Best fit for structure:** [Option Z] — [if applicable]

---

**Next step:** Pick the direction that resonates, or combine elements from multiple options. The thesis can evolve as the content develops — this is a starting point for collaboration.

## Quality Checks for Thesis Options

Each thesis should pass these tests:

**The colleague test:** Could the reader explain this to a colleague in one sentence and capture the argument, not just the subject?

**The organization test:** Does this thesis give the content a spine? Can sections become evidence for it rather than a disconnected list?

**The results test:** Is there a clear business case? Does believing this argument help the reader get better outcomes?

**The tension test:** Does this push against a common assumption or the default approach? If everyone already agrees, it's not a thesis — it's a truism.

## What to Avoid

- **Truisms disguised as theses:** "Marketing strategy is important" isn't an argument anyone would dispute.
- **Taglines without substance:** Clever phrasing that sounds good but doesn't actually organize content or change thinking.
- **Theses that don't fit the content:** The argument needs to work with the material, not against it.
- **Over-complicating:** Keep thesis statements to one sentence. The power is in simplicity.
- **Ignoring the business case:** Every option needs to answer "why does this matter for results?"

## Examples

**Input:** "Brief for an article on audience research for marketers"

**Weak thesis:** "Audience research is essential for marketing success" (truism — no one disagrees)

**Strong thesis:** "Audience research isn't about understanding your customers — it's about finding the gap between what they say and what they do" (misconception-correction, implies a method, suggests transformation)

---

**Input:** "Outline with 8 tips for content writing"

**Weak thesis:** "Here are 8 skills for better content writing" (topic, not argument)

**Strong thesis:** "Great content writing isn't talent — it's building systems to exercise taste consistently" (connects the tips under one principle, challenges the talent myth, implies actionable approach)
