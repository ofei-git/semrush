# Thesis Development Skill

Generates thesis options that transform a topic into a memorable argument.

## What It Does

Most content describes a subject but doesn't make an argument — which is why it gets forgotten. This skill helps find the argument that organizes everything and sticks with the reader.

**Topic:** "How to create a marketing strategy"
**Thesis:** "Marketing strategy answers one question: where does your customer decide?"

## When to Use

- Early ideation — finding the angle before writing the brief
- Briefing — giving writers a through-line to build around
- Revising — strengthening a draft that feels flat or forgettable

## Example Prompts

- "I'm writing about audience research for marketers. Help me find a thesis."
- "Here's my outline for a content writing guide. What argument could tie it together?"
- "This draft covers email marketing basics but feels generic. What's a stronger angle?"
